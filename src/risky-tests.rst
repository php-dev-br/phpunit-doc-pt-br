Risky Tests
***********

PHPUnit can help you identify risky tests, for instance lying tests that give you
a false sense of security.

Tests that are considered risky do not contribute to :ref:`code coverage <code-coverage>`.


.. _risky-tests.useless-tests:

Useless Tests
=============

By default, PHPUnit is strict about tests that do not test anything: tests that do not
perform assertions and do not configure expectations on mock objects.

This check can be disabled by using the ``--dont-report-useless-tests``
option on the :ref:`command-line <textui.command-line-options>` or by setting
``beStrictAboutTestsThatDoNotTestAnything="false"`` in
PHPUnit's :ref:`XML configuration file <appendixes.configuration>`.


.. _risky-tests.unintentionally-covered-code:

Unintentionally Covered Code
============================

PHPUnit can be strict about unintentionally covered code. This check
can be enabled by using the ``--strict-coverage`` option on
the :ref:`command-line <textui.command-line-options>` or by setting
``beStrictAboutCoverageMetadata="true"`` in PHPUnit's
:ref:`XML configuration file <appendixes.configuration>`.

A test that is attributed with ``PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\CoversClass``
or ``PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\CoversFunction`` (or annotated with
:ref:`@covers <appendixes.annotations.covers>`) and that executes code which
is not specified using ``PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\CoversClass``,
``PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\CoversFunction``,
``PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\UsesClass``, or
``PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\UsesFunction`` (or using the
:ref:`@covers <appendixes.annotations.covers>` or
:ref:`@uses <appendixes.annotations.uses>` annotations) will be considered risky
when this check is enabled.

Furthermore, by setting ``requireCoverageMetadata="true"`` in PHPUnit's
:ref:`XML configuration file <appendixes.configuration>`, a test can be considered
risky when it does not have code coverage metadata.


.. _risky-tests.output-during-test-execution:

Output During Test Execution
============================

PHPUnit can be strict about output during tests. This check can be enabled
by using the ``--disallow-test-output`` option on the
:ref:`command-line <textui.command-line-options>` or by setting
``beStrictAboutOutputDuringTests="true"`` in PHPUnit's
:ref:`XML configuration file <appendixes.configuration>`.

A test that emits output, for instance by invoking ``print`` in
either the test code or the tested code, will be considered risky when this
check is enabled.


.. _risky-tests.test-execution-timeout:

Test Execution Timeout
======================

PHPUnit can enforce a time limit for the execution of a test when the ``pcntl`` extension
is available. The enforcing of this time limit can be enabled by using the
``--enforce-time-limit`` option on the :ref:`command-line <textui.command-line-options>`
or by setting ``enforceTimeLimit="true"`` in PHPUnit's :ref:`XML configuration file <appendixes.configuration>`.

A test that is attributed with ``PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\Large``
(or annotated with ``@large``) will be considered risky when it takes
longer than 60 seconds to run. This timeout is configurable via the
``timeoutForLargeTests`` attribute in the
:ref:`XML configuration file <appendixes.configuration>`.

A test that is attributed with ``PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\Medium``
(or annotated with ``@medium``) will be considered risky when it takes
longer than 10 seconds to run. This timeout is configurable via the
``timeoutForMediumTests`` attribute in the
:ref:`XML configuration file <appendixes.configuration>`.

A test that is attributed with ``PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\Small``
(or annotated with ``@small``) will be considered risky when it takes
longer than 1 second to run. This timeout is configurable via the
``timeoutForSmallTests`` attribute in the
:ref:`XML configuration file <appendixes.configuration>`.


.. _risky-tests.global-state-manipulation:

Global State Manipulation
=========================

PHPUnit can be strict about tests that manipulate global state. This check
can be enabled by using the ``--strict-global-state``
option on the :ref:`command-line <textui.command-line-options>` or by setting
``beStrictAboutChangesToGlobalState="true"`` in PHPUnit's
:ref:`XML configuration file <appendixes.configuration>`.
